CSH is a Linux program designed to interface to Space Inventor modules and satellites using a CSP interface. With a CAN dongle the PC will perform as a first-class citizen on the satellite bus and have full access to all systems.

After launch, CSH is also used to operate the satellite through the radio interface, utilising CSPs routing functionalities.

CSH is written in C, and uses the same software libraries (libcsp and libparam) as Space Inventors subsystems. This ensures full compatibility with the protocol stack as well as the higher layer parameter system.
